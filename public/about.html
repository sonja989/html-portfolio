<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there, my name is Sonja Savic Vasic, and I'm a web developer currently based in Vienna, Austria. I was born and raised in Nis, Serbia, but I've been living in Vienna for the past five years.

</p>

<p>My passion for web development started a few years ago, and since then, I've been learning and honing my skills to become a proficient web developer. I'm currently enrolled in a web development course, where I'm acquiring the latest tools and technologies to build responsive and user-friendly websites.

</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, attending tech meetups, and staying up to date with the latest web development trends. I'm also an avid traveler and love discovering new cultures and cuisines.

</p>
<p>If you have any questions or would like to connect, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always happy to chat and share my experiences.
